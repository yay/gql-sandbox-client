On diffing (reconciliation):

When you use React, at a single point in time you can think of the render() function as creating a tree of React elements.
On the next state or props update, that render() function will return a different tree of React elements.
React then needs to figure out how to efficiently update the UI to match the most recent tree.

There are some generic solutions to this algorithmic problem of generating the minimum number of operations
to transform one tree into another. However, the state of the art algorithms have a complexity in the order of O(n3)
where n is the number of elements in the tree.

If we used this in React, displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons.
This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:

1. Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
2. The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.

== Elements Of Different Types ==

Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch.
Going from <a> to <img>, or from <Article> to <Comment>, or from <Button> to <div> - any of those will lead to a full rebuild.

Any components below the root will also get unmounted and have their state destroyed.
This will destroy the old Counter and remount a new one.

<div>
  <Counter />
</div>

<span>
  <Counter />
</span>

== DOM Elements Of The Same Type ==

When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both,
keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes.

After handling the DOM node, React then recurses on the children.

== Component Elements Of The Same Type ==

When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders.
React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls
componentDidUpdate() on the underlying instance.

Next, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result.

== Recursing On Children ==

By default, when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children
at the same time and generates a mutation whenever thereâ€™s a difference.

For example, React will:
- match the two <li>first</li> trees
- match the two <li>second</li> trees
- and then insert the <li>third</li> tree

<ul>
  <li>first</li>
  <li>second</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>first</li>
  <li>second</li>
  <li>third</li>
</ul>

If you implement it naively, inserting an element at the beginning has worse performance.
For example, converting between these two trees works poorly:

<ul>
  <li>Duke</li>
  <li>Villanova</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Connecticut</li>
  <li>Duke</li>
  <li>Villanova</li>
</ul>

React will mutate every child instead of realizing it can keep the <li>Duke</li>
and <li>Villanova</li> subtrees intact. This inefficiency can be a problem.

== Keys ==

In order to solve this issue, React supports a 'key' attribute.
When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree
with children in the subsequent tree.

The key only has to be unique among its siblings, not globally unique.

Note: if a key is an index, component state for things like uncontrolled inputs
can get mixed up and updated in unexpected ways.

Now React knows that the element with key '2014' is the new one,
and the elements with the keys '2015' and '2016' have just moved:

<ul>
  <li key="2015">Duke</li>
  <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li key="2014">Connecticut</li>
  <li key="2015">Duke</li>
  <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul>

In the current implementation, you can express the fact that a subtree has been moved amongst its siblings,
but you cannot tell that it has moved somewhere else. The algorithm will rerender that full subtree.
